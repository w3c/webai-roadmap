      <p>This document provides a technical roadmap describing how Web technologies intersect with emerging AI capabilities. It
      outlines current work across W3C groups, identifies architectural considerations, and highlights areas where
      coordination or new technical exploration may be needed. The roadmap is not a specification. Rather, it aims to support
      discussion, promote shared understanding, and guide the future evolution of the Web in the context of growing AI
      integration.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This document outlines an early roadmap for understanding how AI technologies intersect with the Web platform. Its goals
        are to identify areas where coordinated technical exploration could benefit the ecosystem, highlight emerging patterns,
        and support broader architectural discussions across W3C.
      </p>
      <p class="ednote">This roadmap is intended as a living document and may evolve as the technology landscape develops.</p>

      <h2>AI Capabilities in the Web Platform</h2>
      <p>These technologies provide the fundamental infrastructure required to execute machine learning tasks directly within the
      browser, utilizing underlying hardware for maximum efficiency.</p>

      <h2>Data and Semantics</h2>
      <p>AI systems rely on the organization and expression of data. W3C’s long-standing work in the Semantic Web provides the
      structured framework necessary for AI to interpret information accurately.</p>

      <h2>Web and AI Agents</h2>
      <p>Software agents capable of performing tasks on behalf of users are receiving increasing attention. These agents may
      navigate Web content, invoke APIs, or interact with services in semi-autonomous ways. The Web architecture provides a
      natural environment for such systems, but also introduces new challenges related to permissions, capabilities, user
      control, and predictable behavior. This subsection outlines work areas and technologies relevant to agent interactions
      in Web contexts.</p>
